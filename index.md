This project is a game overlay for [Super Animal Royale](https://animalroyale.com/) provides UI for moders/private match hosters.

It displays bar in the bottom of the screen with buttons. When you click on them, tool set focus on game window and input commands via chat simulating user input.

# Instalation and running

- Install .NET 5.0 for Desktop
- Download latest release from this repository
- Open the game
- Run that application
- Start private match
- Enjoy!

## Usage

I hope interface is friendly for user and don't need an explanation. 

The only non-obvious thing is that right-clicking on the [Kill] [God] [Ghost] buttons applies the command to itself, and for the [Spawn] button - executes the same command that was called the last time when selecting item.
